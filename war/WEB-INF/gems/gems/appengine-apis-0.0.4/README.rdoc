== DESCRIPTION:

APIs and utilities for using JRuby on Google App Engine.

To load the API stubs in IRB simply
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'appengine-apis/local_boot'

This will configure access to the same Datastore as running

  $ dev_appserver.sh .

See these classes for an overview of each API:
- AppEngine::Logger
- AppEngine::Testing
- AppEngine::Users
- AppEngine::Mail
- AppEngine::Memcache
- AppEngine::URLFetch
- AppEngine::Datastore

Unless you're implementing your own ORM, you probably want to use the
DataMapper API instead of the lower level AppEngine::Datastore API.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Google App Engine SDK for Java (http://code.google.com/appengine)
